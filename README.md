# Using-AI-in-a-SOC-Workflow

### This will be a project that will engineer an automated security orchestration and response (SOAR) workflow deployed on a virtual SOC lab using VMware. 
Splunk with n8n will automate security alert ingestion, enrichment, and workflow execution, reducing manual analyst triage
